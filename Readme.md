## Introduction

Weasel is a continuous regression testing solution. It provides open-source
client libraries that enable capturing test results for a given version of
the workflow under test. The captured results can then be submitted to a
remote Weasel Platform where they are stored, interpreted, visualized, and
automatically compared to a *baseline* version of the workflow under test.
If differences are found, Weasel notifies project maintainers and helps them
collaborate with each other to understand the differences and take appropriate
action such as creating a bug report or promoting the baseline version.
