## Resources

Weasel is a continuous regression testing solution that helps engineering
teams understand the impact of their daily code changes.

Weasel enables engineers to establish a baseline for any software execution
workflow that describes the approved behavior and performance of that workflow.
When engineers make subsequent changes to the components involved in that
workflow, Weasel identifies and reports any potential change of behavior
or performance and helps engineers determine if such change matches their
expectations. Weasel allows engineers to keep track of the requirements
of each software component and helps them perform major refactors without
violating those requirements.
